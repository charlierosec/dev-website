# Philly Start Up Sprint [Week 1]

Due to the global pandemic, I had lost my planned spring/summer internship as
the company froze hiring. I applied for a research position at Drexel instead.
This also fell through as it conflicted with my Teaching Assistant position. 
This whole time, my co-op advisor at Drexel had been sending me a variety of
random positions and opportunities that were opening up. Almost all of them 
did not fit my major. The bulk was actually Social Media and Marketing positions
that I do not want. One opportunity was the Philly Start Up Sprint. It's a two
week long conference type experience that's meant to build the skills you would
have recieved in a summer internship. I applied and got in. So for the next two 
weeks, I'll be watching talks and learning about different topics. I figure I
might as well write about the experience here.

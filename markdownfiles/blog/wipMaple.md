# Thoughts on Maple

I'm currently using Maple for the first time in a course at Drexel on
Cryptography and Number Theory. I figured that I would document my experience
in a blog post because I really wish I remembered my first impressions of
languages. I remember only vague opinions of learning new languages for classes.
I really would like to compare my first impression vs using it for 9 weeks.

### Day 1: First Impressions

We were given our first lab which was some basic math functions and a snippet
of code that was to make a list of the prime numbers that are either 128 or 256
bits in length. This forced us to use some math libraries, loops and conditionals.
A fairly basic intro lab. It took me about 20 minutes of learning Maple to get it
right.

I don't know how I feel about the typesetting in Maple. It's a rich text editor
like interface which is offputting to write code next to. I do not like how the
code environment isn't monospaced. The italics are poorly done and the spaces
are too small for me to tell if I used them or not. Hopefully there is a way to
change this setting somewhere. There also was no tabbing which further annoyed
me.

The typesetting makes it feel LaTeXy only because I can put formatted text and
math next to each other. I do like the ability to have a nicely formatted
document with interactive code and math next to it. I always fear making a
minor mathematical error when I'm typing up LaTeX documents.

As for programming, I tend to stick to `vi` and the command line for compiling,
so using an IDE is strange to me. The ability to click on an error message and
have the documentation for said error come up is nice. One thing that will take
time is learning all the shortcuts for typing mathematical functions. I find
myself using the `Palettes` a lot and clicking on the function I need. This
wastes a lot of time where I have to take my hands away from the keyboard and
interrupt my train of thought to find the function I need. The Palette does
save time in scrummaging through documentation for functions. This eased the
learning curve a lot.

I've been writing a lot of C code recently for Advent of Code (I'll write a post
about this later) so the built in functions are wonderfully simple and greatly
appreciated. The list functions were so simple, but my opinion may be skewed
given I've been using C arrays. I used the `isprime` and `nextprime` in the
[NumberTheory Package](https://www.maplesoft.com/support/help/Maple/view.aspx?path=NumberTheory)
and writing code was so simple and required very little thought. Once again, my
opinions may be skewed because I've been handwriting C code recently.

The documentation for Maple isn't too bad. Most of what I needed was short and
sweet and easy to understand.

I'll give Maple a solid **3/5** stars right now. I enjoyed using it today, but I
don't yet see a use for it in my daily life. I feel like I can accomplish the
math with Python and the typesetting with LaTeX.

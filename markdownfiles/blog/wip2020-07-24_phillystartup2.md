# Philly Start Up Sprint [Week 2]

<h3 class="pr">Day 1</h3>

It's a brand new week and I'm already exhausted. Team Lombard is still in first
place! My team is great and we're having so much fun.

Today's topic was mostly marketing based. Lots of advertising, user interfaces,
user experience, graphic design, and branding. Personally, I was really looking
forward to UI/UX since that's a little more technical, but it ended up being 
about tricking consumers into spending more money. I really dislike this shady
aspect of business. Businesses that are in it for the sole purpose of making 
money and not actually bettering something or someone is just not my style and 
I prefer to stay out of that.

Anyway, today's group project was a very involved graphic design and marketing
challenge. We were given a prompt to have one company acquire another. We chose
to hypothetically have [Lyft](lyft.com) acquire [goPuff](gopuff.com). This 
combines the ridesharing with delivery service that can compete with 
[Uber](uber.com) and [UberEats](https://www.ubereats.com/). I was tasked with
creating a logo for the merger, and also an [Instagram](instagram.com) post to
advertise it.

If you look through my 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/charlierosec/PhillyStartupSprint2020) in
my Day06 directory, you can see the interations and concepts I went through when
creating the logo and posts. I played with colors and alignment and language with
the logo. I ended up choosing the final logo with aspects of the Lyft pink and 
the goPuff blue. I played with different angles in the concept art. I tried to 
have thecolors in our Instagram post match those from the logo but with a darker, 
nighttime mood. We chose Will Smith as a hypothetical ambassador. He and the goPuff 
fish are driving a Lyft car through Philly at night, making those late night 
snack deliveries.

We had a bit more time to work on our group projects this week. A little over 12
hours this time around. It was nice to have more time to put thought into our 
designs. I'm happy with what I made overnight. Overall, today I enjoyed the group
project a million times more than the many speakers.

Due to the later due date, I don't know how Lombard is doing today. I hope we're 
still doing alright. Based on the amount of effort I put into graphic design
yesterday, I hope we're still winning.

Today is a great day for me! It's a technical day about Python. It was a really
simple introduction to `numpy` and `pandas` and using Python as a way to show
data manipulation. It was very quick. I spent the training answering questions in
the chat and going over basic syntax and explanations. The presenters were doing
a great job talking and I didn't want them to get overwhelmed with the chat. I 
know I tend to do so in lecture.

While I was really excited for Python and had an awesome time going through the
training, the rest of the day was severely disappointing. The group activity was
going to websites and playing around with the user interfaces. There was also a
random part of the group project about talking with other groups to share points.
Lombard street is probbly gonna be kicked off our top spot, so that's annoying. 
I hate gross disgusting business tactics that have nothing to do with your ability
or what you learned. The afternoon speaker talked about finances. I really
dislike business and this really reminded me that. It's really a shame how that
played out.

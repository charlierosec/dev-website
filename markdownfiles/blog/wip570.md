# COVID-19 and Graduate Courses

The riveting tale of how the professor I work for got COVID-19 and I had to
step in and take over the course. I'm going to set this up as a timeline. The
first few are the events leading up to this. I'll post a daily log of how 
everything is going to chronicle my adventures.

### Tuesday, May 26th

Lecture is normally every Tuesday from 6pm-9pm. This was supposed to be the 
eighth lecture of the term. Due to the global pandemic, Drexel's ten week term
has been shortened to a nine week term. That means this is supposed to be the
second to last lecture of the term. 

The professor starts the lecture stating she is sick. She has a sore throat. 
She asks us to be patient with her. She ends up having a really rough time 
speaking and ends lecture in 45 minutes.

At the time I didn't think anything of it. At this point, we had been in 
quarantine in Philly for about two months. We hadn't heard much about COVID-19
in a while. It did not cross my mind that she was infected.

### Saturday, May 30th

We got a email today from the professor. We hadn't heard much from her at this
point. The subject line was "Bad News" which was worrying. The email was very
brief. The professor had caught COVID-19 and now has pnuemonia. She asked me to
take charge of lecture on Tuesday. I drew up a plan. I knew the topic fairly
well and I have lecturing experience, so I wasn't too worried. The TA I work
with asked if she could have a chance to lecture since she's never done it
before. We only expected to cover the lecture.

I sent out an announcement to the class. I told them all the professor was 
still sick, and that myself and the other TA would be in charge of lecture. 
Students were comfortable with me lecturing as I've done it before in this 
course. I recieved lots of well wishes for the professor. I got one message
from a student, "i hope she's going to be ok. its not the 'rona, is it?". I 
ended up not responding. The whole experience was very chilling.

### Monday, June 1st

Normally, we would have we a weekly Monday meeting with the professor to talk
about the week ahead and grading. Instead, myself and the other TA used the 
time to plan out lecture.

### Tuesday, June 2nd

This is the last lecture of the term. I didn't realize that until I had finished
the lecture. Overall, everything went smoothly. We covered all the material as 
needed. Lots of students asked questions I couldn't answer about the final and
the professor's health.

After lecture, I sent the professor an update email detailing how lecture went
and asking a few questions relating to the remainder of the course. I told 
myself if I didn't have a response by the end of the next day I'd contact the 
department heads on moving forward. There's a lot of time sensitive grades that
need to be dealt with. I don't have time to wait for a response that may never
come.

### Wednesday, June 3rd

I didn't hear back from the professor today. So I contacted the department 
heads. I got a near instantaneous response that they'd be meeting the next day
to discuss moving forward.

### Thursday, June 4th

Today is my first day of doing a daily log. I wrote the past few days to start.
Today was a big day.

I woke up to a long email chain from the department heads, and our department 
technology services master. All they had were final exam questions the professor
had prepped. Thankfully, she had prepped 265 different exam questions. The tech
manager had these all loaded into our Drexel systems for me. We use BlackBoard
Learn at Drexel to host our grades. There were a few questions for me to address
in their emails. I planned a meeting with our undergraduate department head. 
While she isn't the graduate department head, she assigns me courses as a TA and
I've worked with her before.

I met with our undergrad department head. We went over how to create a final from
the list of questions. We went over the weights for the different parts of the 
course. We went over how to curve the course and calculate final grades for 
students. Basically, from here, I am taking control of the course and will be 
reaching out to the department heads when I need help or guidance. 

After my meeting, I ate dinner and got to work. Here's my basic check list of 
what needs to be accomplished. A lot of these things won't be done anytime soon
as they require other deadlines to occur.

**Comprehensive To-Do List** (as of 6/4)

- Update students on the current situation
- Finish grading projects 1 and 2
	- Project 1 can be done
	- Project 2 is due 6/7 and will be graded after then
- Transfer lab grades from zyBooks to BBLearn
	- Lab 8 can be done
	- Lab 9 is due 6/7 and will be done after that
		- Lab 9 also needs to be written down for students so they can do it
- Do a final run down of project, lecture, and lab grades
    - Is everything accounted for
	- Do all students have grades
- Final Exam
	- Categorize the final exam questions
	- Create the exam by pulling X questions from each category
	- Choose size of exam (# of Qs, Points per Q)
	- Post the exam 6/8
	- Create study guide
- Final Grades
	- Create the assignments in BBLearn and weighted columns
	- Create the Preliminary Final Grade column based on the weights
	  from the syllabus
	- Calculate the final letter grades based off final percentage grades (6/16)
	- Curve if need be

First thing I did with my night was to announce and update my students of the 
current situation. The department heads and I agreed it was best to not tell 
students that the professor had COVID-19. They are currently deciding the best 
way for students to be told about the professor will not be attending to the 
rest of the course. Currently, they are deliberating between the department 
emailing students, or me telling them. My announcement today was about the
project and lab grades and the structure of the final exam. I also did an absurd
amount of thanking them for their patience and cooperation. I feel bad for them.
I'm a mess and everything is chaotic, and my grade and education isn't on the 
line. Overall, everyone was receptive. Philly has been experiencing some storms
recently that have caused power outages. I gave some students extensions to get
work done. The most I can do is to be accomodating. I need the. to accomodate 
me. I had to cancel my Friday office hours. This exam needs to be done ASAP so
they have time to take it.

From there I started checking stuff off my list. I started with the grade center
and getting it prepped. I put the columns in for the assignments for Week 9 that
the professor never got around to adding. I got all my weighted columns set up 
and Preliminary Final Grades prepped. I can't tell if it's working until all the 
grades are in on 6/16. I've got something to jump off of.

From there I started reading through the 265 prepared final exam questions. I'm
absurdly thankful the exam questions already exist. I don't think I'd be able to
prepare an exam from scratch this close to the deadline with everything else I'm
taking on. I read through all the questions and started to categorize them. I
managed to break them down into different categories based on topic or structure.
This took way too long and it was getting late. Once I finished that, I have a 
good idea of what the exam is on and what information to tell the students to 
study. I also emailed our tech manager about getting these questions into 
categories on BBLearn. Mine is currently set up on paper. 

The plan for the final is to have pools of questions where X questions from each
category are chosen at random for each student. This way we can allow students
to take different exams at a similar level. For example, let's say we have a pool
of 30 questions. There are 10 easy questions, 10 medium, 10 hard. Each student 
only gets 10 total questions; 5 from the easy pool, 3 medium, 2 hard. This allows
each student to get similar exams, but not the same. This helps prevent 
plagiarism. The exam will be open for a week and students have 2 hours from 
opening it to complete it. This allows students with full time jobs, families, or
in stressful situations to complete on their own time.

I got a lot done today. I also got my first email from the professor since 
Saturday. Very short email. She got released from the ICU today. Terrifying to 
know she's been in the ICU. I'm glad to know she's starting to recover. She
definitely won't be here for the rest of the course, but I'm starting to think
I have things under control. I've got awesome department heads, a great tech
manager, and a completely unrelated mentor professor who's been keeping me sane.
We're all in this together.

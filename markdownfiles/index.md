<h3 class="pr">About Me</h3>

My name is Charlie Rose and I am a third year computer science major at Drexel
University with interests in systems programming and embedded systems. On a 
higher level, I'd like to explore the combination of art, math, and computing.
I am also a highly experienced teaching assistant with plans to get a masters 
and PhD.

I have built this website as a way to showcase my skills, interests, and 
passions in ways that a resume cannot and to give a further glimpse into the
multifaceted person I am.

If you would like my resume or to speak with me more, you can contact me at

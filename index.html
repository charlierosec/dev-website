About Me
</h3>
<p>My name is Charlie Rose and I am a third year computer science major at Drexel University with interests in systems programming and embedded systems. On a higher level, I'd like to explore the combination of art, math, and computing. I am also a highly experienced teaching assistant with plans to get a masters and PhD.</p>
<p>I have built this website as a way to showcase my skills, interests, and passions in ways that a resume cannot and to give a further glimpse into the multifaceted person I am.</p>
<p>If you would like my resume or to speak with me more, you can contact me at me@charlierose.dev</p>
